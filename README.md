###### Streamlit is an open-source Python library that simplifies the process of creating web applications for machine learning and data science projects. It allows developers to create interactive and customizable web apps directly from Python scripts, without needing to know HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

###### Streamlit apps are typically served locally during development, but they can also be deployed to cloud platforms or self-hosted servers for wider distribution. Its simplicity and ease of use make it a popular choice for data scientists and machine learning engineers who want to create web-based interfaces for their projects with minimal effort.
